# pynei

pyNei aims to be a library to do population genetic calculations in Python using standard libraries like pandas, and numpy easy to use in [pyodide](https://pyodide.org/).

It does not include variant IO infrastructure, and all calculations will be done in memory without sofisticated instructure aimed at calculate these stats for large number of SNPs, although it might be the base to build other libraries capable of doing that.
